# Portfolio Hugo M (2025)

An original, dark neon, animated portfolio for a junior engineer specializing in Data Science, ML and AI. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for speed and portability.

## Highlights
- Recruiter-optimized: fast, skimmable sections with strong visuals and clear CTAs
- Sections: Hero, About, Projects (filterable), Contact (validated form)
- Smooth animations: intersection reveal, magnetic hover, 3D tilt card
- Dotted backgrounds, neon glow accents, and responsive layout
- No frameworks; deploy anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)

## Customize
- Update links in `index.html` (GitHub, LinkedIn, email)
- Replace `assets/HugoM_CV.pdf` with your resume file
- Swap avatar (`assets/avatar.svg`) and project images (`assets/placeholders/*.svg`)
- Edit project cards and filters in the Projects section

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser. For smooth history/navigation and CSP headers, use a local server.

Optional: serve via Python

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
python -m http.server 5173 ; Start-Process http://localhost:5173
```

## Deploy
- GitHub Pages: push to repo, enable Pages on main branch root
- Netlify/Vercel: drag-and-drop the folder or connect repository

## SEO
- Semantic HTML, meta description, Open Graph tags, JSON-LD Person schema
- Meaningful alt text, accessible nav and buttons
